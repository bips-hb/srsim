# Simulating Spontaneous Reporting Systems (SRSim)

Spontaneous reporting systems are used in the field of pharmacovigilance to detect (previously unknown) associations between drugs and adverse events (AEs). This `R` package allows for simulating large spontaneous reporting data sets. See https://srs.bips.eu/ for an example on how this simulator could be used.   

### Installation 
To install, simply type in R

```R
devtools::install_github("bips-hb/srsim")
```

### Usage

See for usage the function descriptions, especially 
```R
?SRSim::simulateSRS
```
